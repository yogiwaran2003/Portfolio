                I was born in Tamil Nadu and moved to Pune for my schooling. 
                I completed my education at KVBEG, where I achieved an impressive 85.6% in my 10th grade. 
                Following that, I attended MP Junior College, where I continued to excel academically, scoring 85.17% in my 12th grade. 
                Currently, I am in my final year at MIT World Peace University, pursuing my degree with a CGPA of 8.79. 
                My academic journey has been marked by dedication and hard work, and I am passionate about advancing my knowledge and skills in my chosen field.

                started my journey in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a focus on AI and Machine Learning at MIT World Peace University.
                I’ve consistently performed well academically, with a CGPA of 8.79. 
                My foundational education was at Mahatma Phule International Junior College, where I completed my Class XII with 85.1%, and Kendriya Vidyalaya B.E.G with 87% in Class X.
                Moving forward, I took on an AI internship at Canspirit AI, where I developed AI chatbots and scrapping bots, and contributed to project management systems.
                I have also worked on a variety of personal projects, such as building a herb classification model, cloning the InShorts news app, and developing a Tableau dashboard for customer-market data analysis.
                My skills include Python, C++, Machine Learning, MySQL, and more.

                    <p>
                        **Machine Learning (ML)** is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data 
                        and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. It uses algorithms like neural networks, 
                        decision trees, and regression models to recognize patterns, automate tasks, and improve performance in 
                        applications such as recommendation systems, image recognition, and fraud detection.

                    <p>
                        A Data Analyst collects, processes, and interprets data to help businesses make informed decisions. 
                        They use tools like SQL, Python, Excel, and visualization platforms (Tableau, Power BI) to identify trends, 
                        create reports, and optimize strategies. Their work improves efficiency, predicts outcomes, and supports data-driven 
                        decision-making across industries.

                    <p>
                        Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to model complex patterns 
                        in data. It powers applications like image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems. 
                        Deep learning excels in handling large datasets and is used in AI fields such as computer vision, speech recognition, 
                        and recommendation systems.

                    <p>
                        **MongoDB** is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It is designed for scalability, 
                        high performance, and ease of use. Unlike relational databases, it uses collections and documents instead of tables 
                        and rows, making it ideal for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.

                    <p>
                        Data Structures organize and store data efficiently, enabling optimized operations like searching, sorting, and manipulation. 
                        Common types include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.

                        C++ is a high-performance, object-oriented language used for system programming, game development, and competitive coding.

                        Python is an easy-to-learn, versatile language widely used in web development, data science, AI, and automation.
